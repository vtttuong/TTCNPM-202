Point of sale (POS) or point of purchase is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed.
At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that
amount, may prepare an invoice for the customer, and indicates the options for the customer to
make payment. In restaurant business, Point of sale systems enable the process of ordering food,
notifying status and payment transaction. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, POS systems had gained
traction across the industry. During the coronavirus pandemic, restaurants face greater peril than
ever. Such systems are expected to increase business intelligence, reduce wasted effort and
opportunity to scale to a large business. Our customers have multiple restaurants and have a need to
develop a responsive web-based POS system that implement the current business flow as described
in Figure 1. (The current POS terminal can be replaced in this web-based solution)

### Note:

- The system should be implemented using Web technology and QR code, so customers will
not have to install apps
- The system should be extendable to use in multiple restaurants in the future
- The current transactions is about 300 orders per day.
